## Portfolio
This page has my personalized portfolio information on it. I spent some time playing with HTML and CSS to make it look unique but not overwhelming. I look forward to enhancing it further with JavaScript soon!

## Space Station Site
This page page was a training exercise that uses CSS to create a navar, imagine containers, and dropdowns. As you could probably guess by the title is it space themed.

## BootStrap Project
In this project I used the BootStrap 4 framework and created a movie theater themed webpage with bootstrap components such as navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.

## Shinto Slash Website
I started making this in the beginning of the program during exercises but decided to hold onto it where it is at until I gain more knowledge to make a more compelling website.

## One Page Website

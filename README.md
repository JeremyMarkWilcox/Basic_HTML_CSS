- [Shinto_Slash_Website](Shinto_Slash_Website) (I have more work to do on this!)

## Portfolio
This page has my personalized portfolio information on it. I spent some time playing with HTML and CSS to make it look unique but not overwhelming. I look forward to enhancing it further with JavaScript soon!

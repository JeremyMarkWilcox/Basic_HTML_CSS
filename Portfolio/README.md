## Portfolio
This page has my personalized portfolio information on it. I spent some time playing with HTML and CSS to make it look unique but not overwhelming. 
**Update**
I have added a fade in feature to the top video when the webpage loads.
I have updated the view ports so that the page adjusts to different sizes better. 
I added phone number to the form section and developed it further.
I have added a pop up feature to the contact form with JS and made multiple other alterations.
Added a Favicon, C++ logo since I love the language!
I made many more changes and learn many more things about HTML, CSS, and JS.
